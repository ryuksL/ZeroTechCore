When you decide to take this path, you can no longer look back
brief introduction
The main technology tree of Lingzi Technology
Several basic materials of Lingzi Technology
Zero gel: a cheap general-purpose material that can be used as wood or as a food
Zero fabric: a fabric made of zero gel, which cannot provide any protection, but is very resistant to temperature
Zero sub-alloy: a special alloy synthesized from zero sub-gel and FRP, which is further than FRP in sharpness
Several core materials of Lingzi Technology
Zero mechanical core: a material obtained from the disassembly of the pseudo-personality core, which can be used as a material for many zero buildings, and can also be directly converted into a healing mechanical fluid
Zero energy core: a by-product of the gel maker, which can be used as an energy source for some weapons, or used to upgrade skill levels or as a material
Basically aerial bombs: bombs that fall from the sky but cannot be used directly by the player. How will they appear?
Nine types of gel floor: basic, wood grain, rough sanding, sanding, brick type, delicate, pattern, water grain, planting
Gel maker: It can polish any object into gel, and occasionally produce some special by-products, maybe? Its sharp blades can be used as a weapon
